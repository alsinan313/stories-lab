      <h2>Faith, Resistance, and Identity</h2>

      <p>
        Muhammad Ali’s story is not only about boxing. It is about a public
        decision to choose belief over approval, even when the cost was exile.
      </p>

      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>
        At the height of his career, Ali converted to Islam and refused the
        military draft, framing his decision as a matter of faith and
        conscience.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Turning Points</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Conversion to Islam</li>
        <li>Refusal of the Vietnam draft</li>
        <li>Loss of boxing license</li>
        <li>Eventual return and legacy</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Story Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Ali forces us to confront whether identity is inherited or chosen — and
        what society does to people who choose differently.
